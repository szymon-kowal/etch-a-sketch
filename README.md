## Overview
Languages used : HTML, CSS, JS
This project involves creating a digital sketch pad with a grid of square divs. The grid allows users to hover over the divs, leaving a pixelated trail like a pen. Additionally, there's a button to prompt the user for the number of squares per side, generating a new grid.

## Development Steps

1. **Set Up Git Repository:**
   - Follow the instructions in the Odin's Recipes project to set up a Git repository for this project.
   - Commit early and often with descriptive commit messages.

2. **Create Webpage with Grid:**
   - Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
   - Generate the divs using JavaScript to avoid manual HTML creation.
   - Use a container div to hold the grid.
   - Apply flexbox to make the divs appear in a grid format.

3. **Hover Effect:**
   - Implement a hover effect to change the color of the grid divs when the mouse passes over them.
   - Set up event listeners for mouse enter and leave events.

4. **Button for Grid Resizing:**
   - Add a button to the top of the screen.
   - Use JavaScript to prompt the user for the number of squares per side.
   - Remove the existing grid and generate a new one based on the user input.
   - Limit the user input to a maximum of 100 to prevent potential performance issues.


## Getting Started
